    <p>The budgerigar has co-existed with Indigenous Australians for 50,000–70,000 years. Several possible origins for its name have been proposed. First, it may be a mispronunciation or alteration of the Gamilaraay word gidjirrigaa (Aboriginal pronunciation: [ɡ̊iɟiriɡaː])[9][10] or gijirragaa from the Yuwaalaraay.[11] Second is a modification budgery or boojery (Australian English slang for "good") and gar ("cockatoo").[12] Alternative spellings include budgerygah and betcherrygah,[13] the latter used by indigenous people of the Liverpool Plains in New South Wales.[14] While many references mention "good" as part of the meaning, and a few specify "good bird", it is quite possible that reports by those local to the region are more accurate in specifying the direct translation as "good food".[15] However, reports that this could also translate as "tasty treat", implying they were eaten by the aborigines, are likely to be apocryphal. The name likely derived from the species' migratory nature. With seasonal changes that left the plains barren, the budgerigar would move towards residual water that still produced the seeds they sought. By following the birds, the aborigines could locate water and also other game or food plants – thus, leading to "good food".

        The budgerigar was first described by George Shaw in 1805, and given its current binomial name by John Gould in 1840. The genus name Melopsittacus, from Ancient Greek, means "melodious parrot".[16] The species name undulatus is Latin for "undulated" or "wave-patterned".[17]

        Alternative names for the budgerigar include the shell parrot, the warbling grass parakeet, the canary parrot, the zebra parrot, the flight bird, the scallop parrot. Although more applicable to members of the genus Agapornis, the name lovebird has been applied to them from their habit of mutual preening.[13] The budgerigar was thought to be the link between the genera Neophema and Pezoporus based on the barred plumage.[18] However, recent phylogenetic studies using DNA sequences place the budgerigar very close to the lories (tribe Loriini) and the fig parrots (tribe Cyclopsittini).</p>
